___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
INFO:
Project Started Around 2017-2018 Currently Being Worked On 2020 - active project
Goal Is To Emulate The Xdevkit And Add All Of It's Features and Turn It Into TCPClient Class

Learned:
Having Your Own Class Work Independent IS Much Better Than Running It Threw Interfaces or some unknown code
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Xdevkit Should Pass Threw My Class Then it will be partial classes that do the rest of the work
Note: The Idea Was Good But Lead To A Big Mess... Scraping The Idea And Basically Passing Everything To My DLL
